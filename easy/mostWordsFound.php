// Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences
// A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
// You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.
// Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

// Example 1:
// Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 
// - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
// - The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
// - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
// Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

// Example 2:
// Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
// In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
